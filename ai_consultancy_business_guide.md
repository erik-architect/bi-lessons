# Agent Instructions & Testing Guide
## AI Business Accelerator Content Generation System

### 🎯 Agent Mission Statement
Generate comprehensive, beginner-friendly business education content that takes someone with ZERO business experience and transforms them into a competent AI/MCP consultancy owner ready for acquisition within 4 weeks. Assume no prior knowledge of business fundamentals.

---

## 📋 Content Generation Instructions

### Phase 1: Lesson Planning
Before generating any content, the agent must:

1. **Analyze the lesson topic** against the 4-week timeline
2. **Identify specific learning outcomes** that directly support acquisition goals
3. **Research current market context** for AI/MCP consultancies
4. **Determine visual requirements** for optimal learning
5. **Plan assessment strategies** to ensure knowledge retention

### Phase 2: Content Creation
For each lesson, generate content following this sequence:

#### 2.1 Core Content Development
```markdown
Generate lesson content with ZERO business knowledge assumptions:

Foundation Layer (Always include):
- "What is..." explanations for every business term
- Real-world analogies and examples
- Step-by-step breakdowns of complex concepts
- Common beginner mistakes and how to avoid them
- "Business 101" sidebars for fundamental concepts

Content Structure:
- Executive summary (2-3 sentences in plain English)
- 3-5 key concepts with simple definitions and why they matter
- 2-3 real-world case studies from 2024-2025 (explained for beginners)
- Step-by-step implementation framework (assume no prior knowledge)
- Actual templates and tools with detailed usage instructions
- Assessment questions that test understanding, not memorization

Core Business Fundamentals (must be covered):
- Revenue vs. profit (what's the difference?)
- Cash flow management (money coming in vs. going out)
- Pricing strategies (how to charge for your work)
- Cost management (tracking and controlling expenses)
- Basic accounting (income statements, balance sheets explained simply)
- Tax implications (what you need to know and when to get help)
- Legal basics (contracts, liability, business structure)
- Customer acquisition (finding and keeping clients)
- Project management (delivering work on time and budget)
- Team building (when and how to hire people)
```

#### 2.2 Visual Content Specification
```markdown
For each visual element, specify:
- **Type**: Chart/Graph/Interactive/Dashboard/Framework
- **Purpose**: Why this visual enhances learning
- **Data Requirements**: What information to display
- **Tool Selection**: D3.js/Chart.js/Plotly/Three.js/etc.
- **Implementation Details**: Code structure and key features
- **User Interaction**: How users engage with the visual
```

#### 2.3 Media Generation Commands
When visuals are required, provide exact implementation:

```javascript
// Example: Financial Dashboard Generation
const generateFinancialDashboard = {
  chartType: 'interactive-dashboard',
  dataSource: 'consultancy-metrics',
  visualizations: [
    {
      type: 'line-chart',
      data: 'monthly-revenue',
      library: 'Chart.js',
      features: ['zoom', 'tooltip', 'animation']
    },
    {
      type: 'pie-chart',
      data: 'client-segments',
      library: 'D3.js',
      features: ['hover-details', 'legend']
    }
  ],
  interactivity: {
    filters: ['date-range', 'client-type'],
    exports: ['PDF', 'CSV', 'PNG']
  }
};
```

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
After content generation, the agent must:

1. **Validate against template** - Ensure all sections are complete
2. **Check specificity** - Verify AI/MCP consultancy focus
3. **Assess actionability** - Confirm 24-hour implementation possibility
4. **Review case studies** - Verify accuracy and relevance
5. **Test assessments** - Ensure questions are answerable from content
